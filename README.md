# JX720 is a Kodi skin by JezzX, built off of MC360 by Team Blackbolt. I take no credit for the skin design or coding. 
# This skin is currently BROKEN, and will probably continue to be BROKEN. I'm working on this skin in my spare time for a project.
Modded for Kodi 18.6 Leia and for gaming use.

The Weather blade is currently a copy of the apps blade, I am removing the weather blade entirely and replacing it with Steam functionality hopefully sometime in the future. I have no intentions on fixing it, as the weather area is a waste of space. You are welcome to do so if you use these "fixes" as a base, open source is cool like that. 

Media blade is currently broken.

Goals are as follows:

-Replace Weather blade with Steam functonality. 

-Re-port back in MC360 features that were stripped out (laymans terms: gaming things)

-Fix media functions (the whole point of using Kodi in the first place)

-Change the gamercards back into gamercards, pulling data from steamcommunity
